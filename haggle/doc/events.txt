	Haggle events.
	
	These are the different haggle events, and a short description of what they
	mean and what managers can/should do about them.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_PREPARE_STARTUP:
	FIXME: Undocumented. Please fill in.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_STARTUP:
	FIXME: Undocumented. Please fill in.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_PREPARE_SHUTDOWN:
	FIXME: Undocumented. Please fill in.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_SHUTDOWN:
	This event is posted once when the haggle kernel is starting to shut down, 
	and is a signal to all managers that they should deregister.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_NODE_CONTACT_NEW:
	This event occurs when a new neighbor node is discovered.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_NODE_CONTACT_END:
	This event occurs when a neighbor node disappears.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_NODE_UPDATED:
	This event occurs when a neighbor node's node description is updated.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_NODE_DESCRIPTION_SEND:
	This event can be sent by a manager to trigger the local node's node 
	description to be sent to the current neighbors. For instance when the 
	interests change.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_NEIGHBOR_INTERFACE_UP:
	This event is sent by the connectivity manager when it finds a neighbor's
	interface.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_NEIGHBOR_INTERFACE_DOWN:
	This event is sent by the connectivity manager when it finds that a 
	neighbor's interface is no longer available.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_LOCAL_INTERFACE_UP:
	This event is sent by the connectivity manager when it finds that a local
	interface is available.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_LOCAL_INTERFACE_DOWN:
	This event is sent by the connectivity manager when it finds that a local
	interface is no longer available.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_DATAOBJECT_NEW:
	This event is sent by the data manager when a data object has been inserted
	into the data store.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_DATAOBJECT_DELETED:
	This event is sent by the data manager when a data object has been removed
	from the data store.

	Flag bit:
	1         If this bit is set, the data object should also be deleted
	          from a nodes bloomfilter.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_DATAOBJECT_FORWARD:
	This event is sent by any manager when that manager wishes to send a data 
	object to another node. The forwarding manager will attempt to make sure 
	that the data object reaches the node.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_DATAOBJECT_SEND:
	This event can be generated by any manager to send a data object to another
	node. It is processed by the protocol manager, which will send an 
	EVENT_TYPE_DATAOBJECT_SEND_SUCCESSFUL or EVENT_TYPE_DATAOBJECT_SEND_FAILURE
	event in response, depending on wether it was able to send it or not.
	
	During processing of this event, it is safe to modify the data object to 
	include manager-specific data in non-attribute tags. It is however not safe
	to add or modify attributes, as other managers might rely on the data object
	id.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_DATAOBJECT_VERIFIED:
	This event is sent by the security manager in response to an 
	EVENT_TYPE_DATAOBJECT_RECEIVED event, no matter whether the data object
	passed verification or not. The result of the verification is specified
	in the data object.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_DATAOBJECT_RECEIVED:
	This event is sent by the protocol manager when a data object has been 
	received.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_DATAOBJECT_SEND_SUCCESSFUL:
	This event is sent by the protocol manager in response to an
	EVENT_TYPE_DATAOBJECT_SEND event, if the data object was successfully sent.
	
	Flag bit: Meaning:
	1         If this bit is set, then this event was the result of a reject, 
	          rather than a fully sent data object.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_DATAOBJECT_SEND_FAILURE:
	This event is sent by the protocol manager in response to an
	EVENT_TYPE_DATAOBJECT_SEND event, if the data object was not successfully 
	sent.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_DATAOBJECT_INCOMING:
	This event is sent by the protocol manager when it has received the header
	of a data object. The data object is still being constructed at this point,
	so all of its data may not be available.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_TARGET_NODES:
	This event is sent by the forwarding module in response to a new neighbor
	becoming available. It specifies which nodes the module thinks the neighbor 
	is a good forwarder for. The nodes in the node list (the targets) are not
	complete - only the node id is set correctly.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_DELEGATE_NODES:
	This event is sent by the forwarding module in response to a request for
	good delegates for a certain node. It specifies which nodes the module 
	thinks are likely to be able to forward data objects to the given node. The 
	nodes in the node list (the targets) are not complete - only the node id is 
	set correctly.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_RESOURCE_POLICY_NEW:
	This event is sent by the resource manager when it detects that the 
	resources it is monitoring have changed significantly enough to change the
	resource policy.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_DEBUG_CMD:
	This event is only available when haggle is compiled with debugging enabled.
	It is used by the debug manager to tell other managers to do things in 
	response to input from the user.
	
	EVENT_TYPE_CALLBACK:
	This event type is used to tell a specific manager about some event, without
	having to register a private event type, or posting a public event.


Public events are those that more than one Manager can listen to
Private events are specified by individual managers.
