For debugging and understanding how Haggle works it is
helpful to use a SQLite data base browser such as the
Firefox plugin:

1. Inside Firefox install Firefox SQLite Manager add-on
   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager

2. Launch SQLite manager from the Firefox Tools menu

3. Click File Open icon to open your haggle.db file 
   e.g. from /tmp/pycore.xxxxx/n1.conf/home.user..Haggle./haggle.db
   if you are using CORE lxc containers.

   You now can see the haggle database structure and inside the tables and
   also execute SQL statements (but be careful please).
