In going through the CBMEN Smartphone Network Guide we encountered some
unwanted interference from Ubuntu's network manager. I recommend the following
approach:

1. Backup a working version of your /etc/resolv.conf, to say

/etc/resolve.conf.bak


2. Disable ubuntu's network manager by editing 

/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

and changing the true to false.

3. Stop the puppy

sudo service network-manager stop

4. Make sure the puppy never gets restarted (for example by pluggin
an android phone into a usb port). We did this by adding the 
line 

service network-manager stop

to rc.local


There might be a better way, if so let us all know.
