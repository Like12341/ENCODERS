This directory contains scripts to assist in cross compiling charm for android.

First, create an empty directory to work in. This will be refered to as $BD.
This directory will be refered to as $SCRIPTS
Into this directory, download and decrompress charm and its dependencies. The folder should contain the following subdirectories

android-ndk-r8e (http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html)
android-sdk-linux (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
android-python27 (http://code.google.com/p/android-python27/source/checkout)
gmp (http://gmplib.org/#DOWNLOAD)
pbc (http://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/download.html)
charm (http://www.charm-crypto.com/Main.html)
python-lib (from the PY4A project) (https://code.google.com/p/python-for-android/)

At the beggining of each script is a definition for the $BD variable. Either set these to the path of the directory you just created, or set BD to said directory in your shell

To build the dependencies:
cd $BD/android-python27 && $SCRIPTS/python.sh
cd $BD/gmp && $SCRIPTS/gmp.sh
cd $BD/pbc && $SCRIPTS/pbc.sh
cd $BD/charm && $SCRIPTS/charm.sh

Finnally, to package charm into a zip, run:
cd $BD && $SCRIPTS/collect.sh

This will create a file at $BD/out/python_27.zip. This zip contains the cross compile python, charm, and dependencies.
