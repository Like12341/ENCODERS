Addendum for instructions in the README:

install flex/bison

if you get an error downloading pip (ssl certificate host mismatch)
change bootstrap.sh, build.sh, package.sh to run with bash
add â€”no-check-certificate to functions.sh in downloader wget line

edit python-lib/py4a/__init__.py, replace python2.6 with python 2.7

copy over the pyconfig.h from build/*/include to prebuilt/*/include or there will be complaints about LONG_BIT as the prebuilt file is included and it contains settings for 64 bit systems

use pbc 0.5.14 and gmp 6.0.0a. earlier versions of pbc cause crashes. gmp 6.0.0a is fastest in testing; 5.0.2 is 6% slower (was tested/compiled with --disable-assembly as per upstream); 5.1.3 is 14x slower.
replace the config.sub and config.guess files in pbc and gmp folders with the ones from this folder.

manually relink gmp, editing soname to libgmp.so (copy the link command from when it was built, edit, and rerun)
manually relink pbc, editing soname to libpbc.so (copy the link command from when it was built, edit, and rerun)

for include folder:
cd $BD/out/python
cp -r ../../obj/include .
cd include
cp -r ../../../android-python27/python-build/Python/Include .
cp -r ../../../android-python27/python-build/Python/pyconfig.h .

pyparsing was omitted, have to manually copy the pyparsing.py file into the resulting .zip file inside the site-packages folder
