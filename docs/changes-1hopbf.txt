--------- Haggle limitations/bugs/fixes ---------

None (with respect to 1-hop Bloom filters).

--------- Significant Haggle modifications ---------

 * Added a new manager, the InterestManager, which is responsible for creating
interest data objects which are subsequently disseminated. 

 * Added a NodeManager Node option: "send_app_node_descriptions" which can 
change the default setting for disseminating application node descriptions.
When using the 1-hop Bloom filter feature, this option should be set to false.

 * Added an ApplicationManager option: "delete_state_on_deregister" which can 
change the default setting for when an application deregisters. If set to `true`
then state associated with the deregistered node will be removed. 

 * Modified forwarding manager to route towards application node descriptions that
are missing their device node descriptions.

 * Added 2 new event types:
1) EVENT_TYPE_APP_NODE_CHANGED - raised by the ApplicationManager to indicate
when a node has registered / deleted an interest, or deleted an application. 

2) EVENT_TYPE_ROUTE_TO_APP - raised by the ForwardingManager to indicate that
a data object is to be forwarded towards a target via a particular delegate:
the interest manager listens to this event to consume interests that are 
satisfied by the forwarding. 

 * Added a new option to the forwarding manager to disable mutli-hop Bloom filter
forwarding:

enable_multihop_bloomfilters="false" 

 * Updated ForwardingClassifierNodeDescription to enable forwarding of just
device or application node descriptions (this feature is not currently used).

 * NodeManager fix for "delete_state_on_deregister" option, generally this
parameter should be true when used with 1-hop Bloom filters.  Node.cpp, 
NodeStore.cpp were also modified to support this fix.

 * Added more metrics to Protocol.cpp for application node descriptions (i.e., 
bytes sent/received)

--------- New files ---------

hagglekernel/InterestManager.{cpp,h}: 

A new manager to intercept data object reception events to decode interest 
data objects and generate new interest data objects which are published.
