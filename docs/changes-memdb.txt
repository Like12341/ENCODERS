--------- Haggle limitations/bugs/fixes ---------

None (with respect to memdb).

--------- Significant Haggle modifications ------

hagglekernel/BenchmarkManager.{cpp,h}
- Drastically refactored / cleaned up benchmark code. Also added deletion
tests to record more metrics for DB comparisons. 

hagglekernel/DataStore.{cpp,h}
- Added reportRemoval parameter for "insertDataObject", as occasionally an
insertion of a data object may trigger a deletion of a data object.

hagglekernel/SQLDataStore.cpp
- Added ability to retrieve nodes without trying to fetch them from the node
store (useful when retrieving all nodes during shutdown, `fromScratch` param).  
- Added benchmark metrics for data object deletion and insertion. 
- Added functions to retrieve all of the data objects, nodes and repository
entries from the database.

--------- New files ---------

hagglekernel/MemoryDataStore.{cpp,h}
- Utilizes the MemoryCache to implement the DataStore interface and interact
with the other managers.

hagglekernel/MemoryCache.{cpp, h}
- Stores the state for the in memory NoSQL data base.
